Part 1: 
The provided Java code is a simple console-based program that offers users the choice to either calculate the factorial of a given number or generate a Fibonacci sequence. The main method sets up a menu-driven interface where the user can input their choice. The program continues to execute until the user chooses to exit.

Calculate Factorial:

If the user selects option 1, they are prompted to input a positive integer.
The program then calculates and displays the factorial of that number using a recursive method.
Generate Fibonacci Series:

If the user selects option 2, they input the number of terms they want in the Fibonacci sequence.
The program then generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.
Exit:

If the user selects option 3, the program exits with a farewell message.

Part 2:

MathFunctions Class:
This class provides a set of mathematical functions. Here's a brief overview of each method:

addition: Adds two double numbers.
subtraction: Subtracts the second double number from the first.
multiplication: Multiplies two double numbers.
division: Divides the first double number by the second, throwing an exception if the divisor is zero.
squareRoot: Calculates the square root of a double number.
power: Raises the first double number to the power of the second.
calculateMean: Computes the mean (average) of an array of double numbers.
calculateVariance: Calculates the variance of an array of double numbers.


CalculatorApp Class:
This class serves as an application that utilizes the MathFunctions class to perform various mathematical operations based on user input:

Displays a menu with options for different operations.
Accepts user input to select an operation.
Prompts the user for the necessary numbers based on the chosen operation.
Calls the corresponding method from the MathFunctions class to perform the operation.
Displays the result or statistical measures like mean and variance.
Loops until the user chooses to exit.
